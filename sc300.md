# LP 1 : Explore identity in Microsoft Entra ID

### Describe how MS thinks of essential lifecycle of identity.
- Zero trust : Always desing identity solution with zero trust in mind
- Identity : System which can provide verified accounts for user and application
- Actions : Identity provides actions such AuthN/AuthZ to keep the system running
- Usage : Once identity is provisioned, it can used to access app or services
- Maintain : Always keep identity system up to date.

### Describe zero trust model.
- In simple terms, zero trust means each authN/authZ should be verified irrespective if the request comes from within or outside.
- Zero trust models always usage below 3 principles (or building block of zero trust model).
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/832dedb0-51c1-40cd-b384-bcfa0acca110)

### How Classic Identity is different from Zero Trust identity?
- Earlier a username & password was used to access any/all resources within perimeter network (trusted).
- With Zero Trust, your access is protected everywhere (within perimeter network or outside) by polices.

### Does Zero Trust model only applies to Identity ? 
- No. It should extend to all the digital assest.
- Each element is a source of signal, a control plane for enforcement, and a critical resource to be defended.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24b53932-0c73-4a4b-a304-40cbf7544613)

### What is control plane ?
- A control plane is a tool or service that directs access to resources based on specific criteria. 

### Describe Identity as a control plane.
- With the many networks, devices, and applications needed in daily business, the only common denominator is the identity.
- Every user, external user, app, and device have an identity. So, we say identity is the control plane.

### Why we have identity ?
Identity gives us ability to:
- To prove who or what, we are - **Authentication**
- To get permissions to do something - **Authorization**
- To report on what was done - **Auditing**
- To IT manage and self administer an identity - **Administration**

### What is Identity Provider (IdP) ?
An identity provider (IdP) is a system that creates, manages and stores digital identities. Microsoft Entra ID is an example.

### What are most common capabilities/component of IdP?
- A repository of user identities
- An authentication system
- Security protocols that defend against intrusion
- Someone we trust

### What are some common identity protocl ?
- OIDC
- SAML

### Define Identity Administration.
- Identity administration is how identity objects are managed over the lifetime of the identityâ€™s existence.
- This can be manual or automated.

### What are some common identity administration tasks?
- Identity Proliferation : deals with the storage of identity objects within the environment.
- Provision and Deprovision :
- Identity Updates : how identity information is updated throughout the environment
- Synchronization : ensuring that identity systems within an environment are up to date with the latest identity information
- Password Management : focuses on where and how passwords are set throughout the identity infrastructure
- Group Management : focuses on how an organization manages groups (for example, Active Directory and/or LDAP) within their environment
- Application Entitlement Management : defines on how identities are granted access to applications

### What are Identity automation solution available in Entra ?
- Azure CLI
- Powershell
- Micorosft graph

### What is MS Graph?
- Microsoft Graph exposes REST APIs and client libraries to access data on the following Microsoft cloud services such as Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft 365, devices, and many others.

### Describe properties of MS Graph.
- it offers a single endpoint for all type of request.
```https://graph.microsoft.com```
- MS Graph connectors allow external data into to MS graph ecosystem.
- Microsoft Graph Data Connect provides a set of tools to streamline secure and scalable delivery of Microsoft Graph data to popular Azure data stores.

### Describe Central Identity system.
- Centralized Identity Management or Central Identity System is a single identity tool where credentials are stored and managed, to provide authentication and authorization capabilities
- can be onprem or cloud based.
- centrally managed
- eg: MS EntraID

### Describe Decentralised Identity system.
- A decentralized identity approach helps people, organizations, and things interact with each other transparently and securely, in an identity trust fabric
- People control their own digital identity and credentials. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are different.
- DIDs are user-generated, self-owned, globally unique identifiers rooted in decentralized systems

### Describe identity management solutions.
- An identity solution controls access to an organization's apps and data.
- eg: Microsoft EntraID

## ðŸ“– Day 3 (2025-07-13)

### Define MS Entra B2B.
- If you want to collaborate with Business guest (such user from other organisation or partners), you can use the B2B Identities.

### What are types of B2B Identities.
- **B2B Collaboration:**

Collaborate with external users by letting them use their preferred identity to sign in to your Microsoft applications or other enterprise applications

B2B collab users usually represent as _Guest User_ in your tenant.

- **B2B Direct Connect:**

Establish a mutual, **two-way trust with another Microsoft Entra organization** for seamless collaboration

Supports Teams shared channel enabling externals users to access your resources from within their home instances of Teams.

These users are not visible in your directory

### What is MS Entra B2C (Business to Consumer)?
- B2C provideds identity solution for end user. 
- It is the CIAM (Customer Identity and access management) solution of Microsoft
- Its is different from standard MS EntraID and has different tenant.
- Note : It is getting replaced by MS External ID and will no longer available for new users from May 1, 2025

### What is MS External Identities? What are 2 tenants it defines?
- It is the new solution for external identities (B2B & B2C) by Microsoft.
- 1. Workforce Teanat: the standard EntraID tenant for employees, internal apps and etc. Externals in this tenant are same as B2B Collaboration users.
- 2. External Tenant: this is the B2C replacement and new CIAM solution. This is for end user or business customers.

### Define identity licensing.
- A license is a purchased agreement to allow a user or group of users to use a piece of Microsoft technology.

### Describe common license types.
- Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license
- Microsoft 365, Office 365, and Windows licenses
- Monthly Active User (MAU) license - For MS Entra External Identities

### What is subscription?
- A subscription is an agreement with Microsoft to use one or more Microsoft cloud platforms or services.
- Charges can per-user license fee or cloud resource consumption.
- MS SaSS --> Per-user license
- MS PaSS/Iass --> Cloud resource consumption

### Explain Subscripton vs license.
- a license allows a specific user account to use the services of the cloud offering.
- For example: the Contoso Corporation has a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription with 100 licenses, which allows to up to 100 individual user accounts to use Microsoft 365 E5 features and services

### What is Federation (or Federated Identity)?
- Federation is a collection of domains that have established trust.
- The level of trust varies, but typically includes authentication and almost always includes authorization. 

### What is a claim?
- A claim is simply a piece of information, expressed as a key/value pair. - For example, email=bob@contoso.com.

### What is a Issuer in claim-based Identity?
- Issuer is the entity which authenticates the user and creates the claims.

### Does EntraID limit the set of claims through OIDC?
- Yes. 
- If more user details are required, it can be queried with Graph API.

### What is security token?
Security tokens allow a client application to access protected resources on a resource server.

### What are the 3 common types of tokens?
- Access tokens
- Refresh tokens
- ID tokens

### What is Access token?
- An access token is a security token that's issued by an authorization server as part of an OAuth 2.0 flow. 
- It contains information about the user and the resource for which the token is intended.

### What is refresh token?
- Because access tokens are valid for only a short period of time, authorization servers will sometimes issue a refresh token at the same time the access token is issued.
- The client application can then exchange this refresh token for a new access token when needed.

### What is ID token?
- ID tokens are sent to the client application as part of an OpenID Connect flow.
- They can be sent alongside or instead of an access token. 
- ID tokens are used by the client to authenticate the user.

### What is JSON Web Token (JWT)?
- JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

### What are some common Authorization approaches?
- Access Control List (ACL)
- Role-Based Access Control List (RBAC)
- Attribute-Based Access Control List (ABAC)
- Policy-Based Access Control List (PBAC)

### Define Access Control List.
- An explicit list of specific entities who do or don't have access to a resource or functionality. 
- Offers, fine control over resources, but often difficult to maintain with large groups of users and resources.

### Define Role-Based Access Control List (RBAC).
- Roles are defined to describe the kinds of activities an entity can perform. Grant access to roles rather than to individual entities.
- An administrator can then assign roles to different entities to control which ones have access to what resources and functionality.
- This is the most common approach to enforcing authorization.

### Define Attribute-Based Access Control List (ABAC).
- Rules are applied to attributes of the entity, the resources being accessed, and the current environment to determine whether access to some resources or functionality is permitted.

### Policy-Based Access Control List (PBAC).
- A strategy for managing user access to one or more systems, where the business-role of the user is combined with policies to determine what access the user has.

### What is Authentication Context in EntraID?
- Authentication context can be used to further secure data and actions in applications.

## ðŸ“– Day 4 - 2025-07-14

### What is auditing and why it is required?
- Auditing provides a way for an administrator to detect an attack that has already occurred or is in progress.
- Also, auditing is a tool for compliance and tracking what identity did what.

### Define Governance in Identity.
- governance is the act or process of overseeing the control and direction of a system.
- Governance has processes and controls in place to both operate the systems and to evaluate the accountable running of the system.

### Define Identity Lifecycle managment.
- Identity Lifecycle Management aims to automate and manage the entire digital identity lifecycle process.

### Define JML process.
- Joiner
- Leaver
- Mover

- can change pwd for users, Helpdesk Admin and other User Admin

### Can User admin role manage support tickets?
- yes

### User Admin roles can perform pwd reset for __?
- user
- helpdesk admin
- other user admin

### What are Azure roles?
- Azure roles control permissions to manage Azure resources

### What is difference between Azure roles & Microsoft Entra roles?
|Action|Azure Roles|Entra Roles|
|------|-----------|-----------|
|Resources|Manage access to Azure Resouces | Manage access to Entra ID  |
|Custom Roles| Yes | Yes |
|Scope | Multiple Levels (MG, subs, rg, resource) | Only two Level - tenant or AU|
|Role info | Role information can be accessed in Azure portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure Resource Manager templates, REST API | Role information can be accessed in Azure admin portal, Microsoft 365 admin center, Microsoft Graph, and PowerShell |

- <img width="785" height="587" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92c6c69f-9949-476e-b42b-d0f66448e0a9" />
- eg: Global Admin, User Admin
  
### Does Entra ID Global Admin has access to Azure resources?
- No. Not by default.

### Is Global Admin can escalate their privledge and access azure resources.
- Yes
- However, if a Global Administrator elevates their access by choosing the Access management for Azure resources switch in the Azure portal, they're granted the User Access Administrator role (an Azure role) on all subscriptions for a particular tenant. The User Access Administrator role enables the user to grant other users access to Azure resources. This switch can be helpful to regain access to a subscription.

### How we can roles to users?
- there are multiple ways to this:
- a) Assign a role to a user or group
- b) Assign a user or group to a role
- c) Assign a role to a broad-scope, like a Subscription, Resource Group, or Management Group
- d) Assign a role using PowerShell or Microsoft Graph API
- e) Assign a role using Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

### Explain the steps for Assign a role to a user or group
- Microsoft Entra ID - Roles and administration - Select a role - + Add Assignment

### Explain the steps for Assign a user or group to a role
- Microsoft Entra ID - Open Users (or Groups) - Select an User (or group) - Assigned roles - + Add Assignment

### Explain the steps for Assign a role to a broad-scope, like a Subscription, Resource Group, or Management Group
- Done via the Access control (IAM) within each settings screen

### Explain steps for using PIM to assign a role.
- // todo

### At what level we can assign EntraID custom roles ?
- directory level
- app registration level

### Where we can create EntraID custom roles?
- Roles and administration tab in EntraID

### How to create a Entra custom roles?
