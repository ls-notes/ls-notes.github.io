# LP 1 : Explore identity in Microsoft Entra ID

### Describe how MS thinks of essential lifecycle of identity.
- Zero trust : Always desing identity solution with zero trust in mind
- Identity : System which can provide verified accounts for user and application
- Actions : Identity provides actions such AuthN/AuthZ to keep the system running
- Usage : Once identity is provisioned, it can used to access app or services
- Maintain : Always keep identity system up to date.

### Describe zero trust model.
- In simple terms, zero trust means each authN/authZ should be verified irrespective if the request comes from within or outside.
- Zero trust models always usage below 3 principles (or building block of zero trust model).
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/832dedb0-51c1-40cd-b384-bcfa0acca110)

### How Classic Identity is different from Zero Trust identity?
- Earlier a username & password was used to access any/all resources within perimeter network (trusted).
- With Zero Trust, your access is protected everywhere (within perimeter network or outside) by polices.

### Does Zero Trust model only applies to Identity ? 
- No. It should extend to all the digital assest.
- Each element is a source of signal, a control plane for enforcement, and a critical resource to be defended.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24b53932-0c73-4a4b-a304-40cbf7544613)

### What is control plane ?
- A control plane is a tool or service that directs access to resources based on specific criteria. 

### Describe Identity as a control plane.
- With the many networks, devices, and applications needed in daily business, the only common denominator is the identity.
- Every user, external user, app, and device have an identity. So, we say identity is the control plane.

### Why we have identity ?
Identity gives us ability to:
- To prove who or what, we are - **Authentication**
- To get permissions to do something - **Authorization**
- To report on what was done - **Auditing**
- To IT manage and self administer an identity - **Administration**

### What is Identity Provider (IdP) ?
An identity provider (IdP) is a system that creates, manages and stores digital identities. Microsoft Entra ID is an example.

### What are most common capabilities/component of IdP?
- A repository of user identities
- An authentication system
- Security protocols that defend against intrusion
- Someone we trust

### What are some common identity protocl ?
- OIDC
- SAML

### Define Identity Administration.
- Identity administration is how identity objects are managed over the lifetime of the identityâ€™s existence.
- This can be manual or automated.

### What are some common identity administration tasks?
- Identity Proliferation : deals with the storage of identity objects within the environment.
- Provision and Deprovision :
- Identity Updates : how identity information is updated throughout the environment
- Synchronization : ensuring that identity systems within an environment are up to date with the latest identity information
- Password Management : focuses on where and how passwords are set throughout the identity infrastructure
- Group Management : focuses on how an organization manages groups (for example, Active Directory and/or LDAP) within their environment
- Application Entitlement Management : defines on how identities are granted access to applications

### What are Identity automation solution available in Entra ?
- Azure CLI
- Powershell
- Micorosft graph

### What is MS Graph?
- Microsoft Graph exposes REST APIs and client libraries to access data on the following Microsoft cloud services such as Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft 365, devices, and many others.

### Describe properties of MS Graph.

```https://graph.microsoft.com```
- MS Graph connectors allow external data into to MS graph ecosystem.
- Microsoft Graph Data Connect provides a set of tools to streamline secure and scalable delivery of Microsoft Graph data to popular Azure data stores.

### Describe Central Identity system.
- Centralized Identity Management or Central Identity System is a single identity tool where credentials are stored and managed, to provide authentication and authorization capabilities
- can be onprem or cloud based.
- centrally managed
- eg: MS EntraID

### Describe Decentralised Identity system.
- A decentralized identity approach helps people, organizations, and things interact with each other transparently and securely, in an identity trust fabric
- People control their own digital identity and credentials. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are different.
- DIDs are user-generated, self-owned, globally unique identifiers rooted in decentralized systems

### What is security token?
Security tokens allow a client application to access protected resources on a resource server.

### What are the 3 common types of tokens?
- Access tokens
- Refresh tokens
- ID tokens

### What is Access token?
- An access token is a security token that's issued by an authorization server as part of an OAuth 2.0 flow. 
- It contains information about the user and the resource for which the token is intended.

### What is refresh token?
- Because access tokens are valid for only a short period of time, authorization servers will sometimes issue a refresh token at the same time the access token is issued.
- The client application can then exchange this refresh token for a new access token when needed.

### What is ID token?
- ID tokens are sent to the client application as part of an OpenID Connect flow.
- They can be sent alongside or instead of an access token. 
- ID tokens are used by the client to authenticate the user.

### Define Access Control List.
- An explicit list of specific entities who do or don't have access to a resource or functionality. 
- Offers, fine control over resources, but often difficult to maintain with large groups of users and resources.

### Define Role-Based Access Control List (RBAC).
- Roles are defined to describe the kinds of activities an entity can perform. Grant access to roles rather than to individual entities.
- An administrator can then assign roles to different entities to control which ones have access to what resources and functionality.
- This is the most common approach to enforcing authorization.

### Define Attribute-Based Access Control List (ABAC).
- Rules are applied to attributes of the entity, the resources being accessed, and the current environment to determine whether access to some resources or functionality is permitted.

### Policy-Based Access Control List (PBAC).
- A strategy for managing user access to one or more systems, where the business-role of the user is combined with policies to determine what access the user has.

### What is Authentication Context in EntraID?
- Authentication context can be used to further secure data and actions in applications.

## ðŸ“– Day 4 - 2025-07-14

- Also, auditing is a tool for compliance and tracking what identity did what.

### Define Governance in Identity.
- governance is the act or process of overseeing the control and direction of a system.
- Governance has processes and controls in place to both operate the systems and to evaluate the accountable running of the system.

### Define Identity Lifecycle managment.
- Identity Lifecycle Management aims to automate and manage the entire digital identity lifecycle process.

### Define JML process.
- Joiner
- Leaver
- Mover
