# LP 1 : Explore identity in Microsoft Entra ID

### Describe how MS thinks of essential lifecycle of identity.
- Zero trust : Always desing identity solution with zero trust in mind
- Identity : System which can provide verified accounts for user and application
- Actions : Identity provides actions such AuthN/AuthZ to keep the system running
- Usage : Once identity is provisioned, it can used to access app or services
- Maintain : Always keep identity system up to date.

### Describe zero trust model.
- In simple terms, zero trust means each authN/authZ should be verified irrespective if the request comes from within or outside.
- Zero trust models always usage below 3 principles (or building block of zero trust model).

### How Classic Identity is different from Zero Trust identity?
- Earlier a username & password was used to access any/all resources within perimeter network (trusted).
- With Zero Trust, your access is protected everywhere (within perimeter network or outside) by polices.

### Does Zero Trust model only applies to Identity ? 
- No. It should extend to all the digital assest.
- Each element is a source of signal, a control plane for enforcement, and a critical resource to be defended.

### What is control plane ?
- A control plane is a tool or service that directs access to resources based on specific criteria. 

### Describe Identity as a control plane.
- With the many networks, devices, and applications needed in daily business, the only common denominator is the identity.
- Every user, external user, app, and device have an identity. So, we say identity is the control plane.

### Why we have identity ?
Identity gives us ability to:
- To prove who or what, we are - **Authentication**
- To get permissions to do something - **Authorization**
- To report on what was done - **Auditing**
- To IT manage and self administer an identity - **Administration**

### What is Identity Provider (IdP) ?
An identity provider (IdP) is a system that creates, manages and stores digital identities. Microsoft Entra ID is an example.

### What are most common capabilities/component of IdP?
- A repository of user identities
- An authentication system
- Security protocols that defend against intrusion
- Someone we trust

### What are some common identity protocl ?
- OIDC
- SAML

### Define Identity Administration.
- Identity administration is how identity objects are managed over the lifetime of the identityâ€™s existence.
- This can be manual or automated.

### What are some common identity administration tasks?
- Identity Proliferation : deals with the storage of identity objects within the environment.
- Provision and Deprovision :
- Identity Updates : how identity information is updated throughout the environment
- Synchronization : ensuring that identity systems within an environment are up to date with the latest identity information
- Password Management : focuses on where and how passwords are set throughout the identity infrastructure
- Group Management : focuses on how an organization manages groups (for example, Active Directory and/or LDAP) within their environment
- Application Entitlement Management : defines on how identities are granted access to applications

### What are Identity automation solution available in Entra ?
- Azure CLI
- Powershell
- Micorosft graph

### What is MS Graph?
- Microsoft Graph exposes REST APIs and client libraries to access data on the following Microsoft cloud services such as Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft 365, devices, and many others.

### Describe properties of MS Graph.
- it offers a single endpoint for all type of request.
```https://graph.microsoft.com```
- MS Graph connectors allow external data into to MS graph ecosystem.
- Microsoft Graph Data Connect provides a set of tools to streamline secure and scalable delivery of Microsoft Graph data to popular Azure data stores.

### Describe Central Identity system.
- Centralized Identity Management or Central Identity System is a single identity tool where credentials are stored and managed, to provide authentication and authorization capabilities
- can be onprem or cloud based.
- centrally managed
- eg: MS EntraID

### Describe Decentralised Identity system.
- A decentralized identity approach helps people, organizations, and things interact with each other transparently and securely, in an identity trust fabric
- People control their own digital identity and credentials. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are different.
- DIDs are user-generated, self-owned, globally unique identifiers rooted in decentralized systems

### Describe identity management solutions.
- An identity solution controls access to an organization's apps and data.
- eg: Microsoft EntraID

## Day 2 - 2025-07-12

### Is EntraID flat structure IDP?
- Yes

### Define authentication. 
- he process of authentication controls who or what uses an account.

### What is mean by authorisation?
- Authorization controls what the user can do in applications.

### Define Identity in EntraID.
- An object that can get authenticated.
- An identity can be a user with a username and password.
- it can application or server that might require authentication via secret keys or certificates.

### Define Account in EntraID.
- An identity that has data associated with it.
- You can't have an account without an identity.

### Define MS Entra Account.
- An identity created through Microsoft Entra ID or another Microsoft cloud service, such as Microsoft 365.
- AKA work or school account

### What is the other name of MS Entra Account?
- Work or school account

### Define a User in Entra.
- A single personal verifiable identity in Microsoft Entra ID.

### Define Group in Entra.
- A container of users or identities that can be assigned security privileges or restrictions

### Define Azure Subscription.
- Used to pay for Azure cloud services
- can have more than 1 subscriptions

### Define MS Entra tenant/directory.
- Tenant or directory is a **dedicated and trusted instance** of MS EntraID.
- It is automatically created when an organisation (or individual) signs up for MS cloud service subscription.

### Are tenant and directory same in context of EntraID.
- Yes

### Define Administrative unit.
- A portioned off piece of a Microsoft Entra tenant used to create and administrative boundary.
- basically like OU but limited.
