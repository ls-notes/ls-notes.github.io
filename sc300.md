# LP 1 : Explore identity in Microsoft Entra ID

### Describe how MS thinks of essential lifecycle of identity.
- Zero trust : Always desing identity solution with zero trust in mind
- Identity : System which can provide verified accounts for user and application
- Actions : Identity provides actions such AuthN/AuthZ to keep the system running
- Usage : Once identity is provisioned, it can used to access app or services
- Maintain : Always keep identity system up to date.

### Describe zero trust model.
- In simple terms, zero trust means each authN/authZ should be verified irrespective if the request comes from within or outside.
- Zero trust models always usage below 3 principles (or building block of zero trust model).

### How Classic Identity is different from Zero Trust identity?
- Earlier a username & password was used to access any/all resources within perimeter network (trusted).
- With Zero Trust, your access is protected everywhere (within perimeter network or outside) by polices.

### Does Zero Trust model only applies to Identity ? 
- No. It should extend to all the digital assest.
- Each element is a source of signal, a control plane for enforcement, and a critical resource to be defended.

### What is control plane ?
- A control plane is a tool or service that directs access to resources based on specific criteria. 

### Describe Identity as a control plane.
- With the many networks, devices, and applications needed in daily business, the only common denominator is the identity.
- Every user, external user, app, and device have an identity. So, we say identity is the control plane.

### Why we have identity ?
Identity gives us ability to:
- To prove who or what, we are - **Authentication**
- To get permissions to do something - **Authorization**
- To report on what was done - **Auditing**
- To IT manage and self administer an identity - **Administration**

### What is Identity Provider (IdP) ?
An identity provider (IdP) is a system that creates, manages and stores digital identities. Microsoft Entra ID is an example.

### What are most common capabilities/component of IdP?
- A repository of user identities
- An authentication system
- Security protocols that defend against intrusion
- Someone we trust

### What are some common identity protocl ?
- OIDC
- SAML

### Define Identity Administration.
- Identity administration is how identity objects are managed over the lifetime of the identityâ€™s existence.
- This can be manual or automated.

### What are some common identity administration tasks?
- Identity Proliferation : deals with the storage of identity objects within the environment.
- Provision and Deprovision :
- Identity Updates : how identity information is updated throughout the environment
- Synchronization : ensuring that identity systems within an environment are up to date with the latest identity information
- Password Management : focuses on where and how passwords are set throughout the identity infrastructure
- Group Management : focuses on how an organization manages groups (for example, Active Directory and/or LDAP) within their environment
- Application Entitlement Management : defines on how identities are granted access to applications

### What are Identity automation solution available in Entra ?
- Azure CLI
- Powershell
- Micorosft graph

### What is MS Graph?
- Microsoft Graph exposes REST APIs and client libraries to access data on the following Microsoft cloud services such as Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft 365, devices, and many others.

### Describe properties of MS Graph.
- it offers a single endpoint for all type of request.
```https://graph.microsoft.com```
- MS Graph connectors allow external data into to MS graph ecosystem.
- Microsoft Graph Data Connect provides a set of tools to streamline secure and scalable delivery of Microsoft Graph data to popular Azure data stores.

### Describe Central Identity system.
- Centralized Identity Management or Central Identity System is a single identity tool where credentials are stored and managed, to provide authentication and authorization capabilities
- can be onprem or cloud based.
- centrally managed
- eg: MS EntraID

### Describe Decentralised Identity system.
- A decentralized identity approach helps people, organizations, and things interact with each other transparently and securely, in an identity trust fabric
- People control their own digital identity and credentials. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are different.
- DIDs are user-generated, self-owned, globally unique identifiers rooted in decentralized systems

### Describe identity management solutions.
- An identity solution controls access to an organization's apps and data.
- eg: Microsoft EntraID

- An identity can be a user with a username and password.
- it can application or server that might require authentication via secret keys or certificates.

### Define Account in EntraID.
- An identity that has data associated with it.
- You can't have an account without an identity.

- AKA work or school account

### What is the other name of MS Entra Account?
- Work or school account

### Define a User in Entra.
- A single personal verifiable identity in Microsoft Entra ID.

### Define Group in Entra.
- A container of users or identities that can be assigned security privileges or restrictions

### Define Azure Subscription.
- Used to pay for Azure cloud services
- can have more than 1 subscriptions

### Define MS Entra tenant/directory.
- Tenant or directory is a **dedicated and trusted instance** of MS EntraID.
- It is automatically created when an organisation (or individual) signs up for MS cloud service subscription.

### Are tenant and directory same in context of EntraID.
- Yes

### Define Administrative unit.
- A portioned off piece of a Microsoft Entra tenant used to create and administrative boundary.
- basically like OU but limited.

## ðŸ“– Day 3 (2025-07-13)

### Define MS Entra B2B.
- If you want to collaborate with Business guest (such user from other organisation or partners), you can use the B2B Identities.

### What are types of B2B Identities.
- **B2B Collaboration:**
Collaborate with external users by letting them use their preferred identity to sign in to your Microsoft applications or other enterprise applications

B2B collab users usually represent as _Guest User_ in your tenant.

- **B2B Direct Connect:**
Establish a mutual, **two-way trust with another Microsoft Entra organization** for seamless collaboration

Supports Teams shared channel enabling externals users to access your resources from within their home instances of Teams.

These users are not visible in your directory

### What is MS Entra B2C (Business to Consumer)?
- B2C provideds identity solution for end user. 
- It is the CIAM (Customer Identity and access management) solution of Microsoft
- Its is different from standard MS EntraID and has different tenant.
- Note : It is getting replaced by MS External ID and will no longer available for new users from May 1, 2025

### What is MS External Identities? What are 2 tenants it defines?
- It is the new solution for external identities (B2B & B2C) by Microsoft.
- 1. Workforce Teanat: the standard EntraID tenant for employees, internal apps and etc. Externals in this tenant are same as B2B Collaboration users.
- 2. External Tenant: this is the B2C replacement and new CIAM solution. This is for end user or business customers.

### Define identity licensing.
- A license is a purchased agreement to allow a user or group of users to use a piece of Microsoft technology.

### Describe common license types.
- Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license
- Microsoft 365, Office 365, and Windows licenses
- Monthly Active User (MAU) license - For MS Entra External Identities
- Others

### What is subscription?
- A subscription is an agreement with Microsoft to use one or more Microsoft cloud platforms or services.
- Charges can per-user license fee or cloud resource consumption.
- MS SaSS --> Per-user license
- MS PaSS/Iass --> Cloud resource consumption

### Explain Subscripton vs license.
- a license allows a specific user account to use the services of the cloud offering.
- For example: the Contoso Corporation has a Microsoft 365 E5 subscription with 100 licenses, which allows to up to 100 individual user accounts to use Microsoft 365 E5 features and services

### What is Federation (or Federated Identity)?
- Federation is a collection of domains that have established trust.
- The level of trust varies, but typically includes authentication and almost always includes authorization. 

### What is a claim?
- A claim is simply a piece of information, expressed as a key/value pair. - For example, email=bob@contoso.com.

### What is a Issuer in claim-based Identity?
- Issuer is the entity which authenticates the user and creates the claims.

### Does EntraID limit the set of claims through OIDC?
- Yes. 
- If more user details are required, it can be queried with Graph API.

### What is security token?
Security tokens allow a client application to access protected resources on a resource server.

### What are the 3 common types of tokens?
- Access tokens
- Refresh tokens
- ID tokens

### What is Access token?
- An access token is a security token that's issued by an authorization server as part of an OAuth 2.0 flow. 
- It contains information about the user and the resource for which the token is intended.

### What is refresh token?
- Because access tokens are valid for only a short period of time, authorization servers will sometimes issue a refresh token at the same time the access token is issued.
- The client application can then exchange this refresh token for a new access token when needed.

### What is ID token?
- ID tokens are sent to the client application as part of an OpenID Connect flow.
- They can be sent alongside or instead of an access token. 
- ID tokens are used by the client to authenticate the user.

### What is JSON Web Token (JWT)?
- JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

### What are some common Authorization approaches?
- Access Control List (ACL)
- Role-Based Access Control List (RBAC)
- Attribute-Based Access Control List (ABAC)
- Policy-Based Access Control List (PBAC)

### Define Access Control List.
- An explicit list of specific entities who do or don't have access to a resource or functionality. 
- Offers, fine control over resources, but often difficult to maintain with large groups of users and resources.

### Define Role-Based Access Control List (RBAC).
- Roles are defined to describe the kinds of activities an entity can perform. Grant access to roles rather than to individual entities.
- An administrator can then assign roles to different entities to control which ones have access to what resources and functionality.
- This is the most common approach to enforcing authorization.

### Define Attribute-Based Access Control List (ABAC).
- Rules are applied to attributes of the entity, the resources being accessed, and the current environment to determine whether access to some resources or functionality is permitted.

### Policy-Based Access Control List (PBAC).
- A strategy for managing user access to one or more systems, where the business-role of the user is combined with policies to determine what access the user has.

### What is Authentication Context in EntraID?
- Authentication context can be used to further secure data and actions in applications.
